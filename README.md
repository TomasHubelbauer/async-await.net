### Node 16 with top-level `await` (TLA) and asynchronous timers is out!

[Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) is finally out and brings us
support for top-level `await` as well as asynchronous timers. I've demonstrated
how to use both of these features in conjunctions with GitHub Actions in my
[github-actions-node-16](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/github-actions-node-16)
repository. Check it out and provide feedback!

[Permalink to Node 16 downloads](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v16.0.0/):
the above link is for the current version and has a nicer webpage. This is a
permalink in case you're seeing this post much later.
