In this repository I demonstrate a GitHub Action which runs a Create React App
application build and places the artifacts onto an application server using SSH.

## Running

```sh
cd src
npm install
npm start
```

## Deployment

GitHub Actions continuous delivery is set up in
[`main.yml`](.github/workflows/mail.yml).
