## To-Do

### Setup up a WWW subdomain in addition to the apex domain like hubelbauer.net

I have left a good trail of commits on there walking through the process, so it
should be easy and successful to repeat it here.

### Buy the `.cz` and set up pipelines for checks similar to hubelbauer.net

Add pipelines for DNS A, DNS AAAA, LE, WWW and HTTPS redirects, GitHub Pages and
so on as per the `hubelbauer.net` repository:
